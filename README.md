SC2-Analysis
============

A two part project. Part one will be a program that can extract sc2 replay information and insert it into HBase. Data will also be placed into a RDBMS to index HBase information. Part two will be a set of hadoop jobs that analyze the sequence files. Ideally, each sequence file would either be attributed to a player, or a tournament.
